Description:
    I use this repository to store my linux settings files.
    To use these files:
        1. Clone this repository anywhere in your directory.
        2. Backup your original settings files (~/.vimrc etc).
        3. Run the set_symlinks.py script.
    The set_symlinks.py will REPLACE your settings files.
